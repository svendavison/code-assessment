# TODO
I've come to find a couple things that I want to learn how to do. This is in no way a full/complete list.

* Make instructors a lookup/foreign table
    * Hand jamming the instructor names is not ideal
* Change the display value of the student result to include/the display name.

```JSON
    {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/student/10/",
        "id": 10,
        "Name": "Sven Davison",
        "StudentId": 23,
        "Courses": [
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/6/",
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/8/",
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/courses/9/"
        ]
    }
```
